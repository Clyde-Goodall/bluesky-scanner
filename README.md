# BluesyScanner
This digests the incoming jetstream content from Bluesky and allows custom filtering logic, with the ability to dump matching filter results to MongoDB.
It's more of a personal tool that I would just like to have stored on here, but I'm making an effort to make it more user-friendly.
I whipped this up in an evening, and it's fun working with bluesky's real-time data stream. If you're reading this, don't expect much.
